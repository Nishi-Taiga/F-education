# Authentication Fix Summary

This PR addresses the authentication error that was occurring during login. There were multiple issues that were fixed:

## Root Causes

1. **Multiple GoTrueClient instances**: The application had two different authentication contexts (`AuthProvider` in contexts/auth-provider.tsx and hooks/use-auth.tsx) causing conflicts.

2. **404 API Error**: The application was trying to fetch from `/api/user` but the actual endpoint was `/api/user/me`.

3. **Missing QueryClient Provider**: The React Query client wasn't properly set up in the application.

## Changes Made

1. **Corrected API endpoint**: Updated the API endpoint from `/api/user` to `/api/user/me` in the authentication hook.

2. **Unified Auth Provider**: Removed the duplicate auth provider and consolidated to use just one.

3. **Singleton Pattern for Supabase**: Implemented a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the Supabase client is used throughout the application.

4. **Added QueryClientProvider**: Set up proper React Query provider in the root layout.

5. **Added New API Route**: Created a `/api/user` route to match the frontend's authentication functionality.

6. **Updated Server Auth Client**: Updated the server-side Supabase client configuration to match the client pattern.

These changes should resolve the authentication errors and ensure a smooth login experience for users.
